# CatanAI

A dissertation project focused on developing intelligent agents for Settlers of Catan.

## Overview

This project is still in development.

This project explores the development of AI strategies for Catan, one of the most popular modern board games. Catan presents unique computational challenges through its combination of resource management, player interaction, and spatial strategy.

## The Challenge

Catan creates an interesting environment for AI development due to:
- Imperfect information about other players' cards and intentions
- Complex resource management and probability calculations
- Dynamic player interactions through trading
- Critical importance of initial placement decisions

## Project Goals

The AI aims to:
- Evaluate board states effectively
- Model and predict opponent behavior
- Develop long-term strategic planning
- Handle resource negotiation and trading
